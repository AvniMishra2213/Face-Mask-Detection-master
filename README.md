Affecting the health and lives of masses, COVID-19 has called for strict measures to be followed in order to prevent the spread of disease. From the very basic hygiene standards to the treatments in the hospitals, people are doing all they can for their own and the societyâ€™s safety; face masks are one of the personal protective equipment. People wear face masks once they step out of their homes and authorities strictly ensure that people are wearing face masks while they are in groups and public places. To monitor that people are following this basic safety principle, a strategy should be developed.
